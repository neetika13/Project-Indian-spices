# Spice up your life

This site is targeting people who are foodies and at the same time are health concious. Spices are known to have medicinal and healing properties. They can boost methabolism and promote weight loss, but also fight diabetes, heart conditions, arthritis and even cancer. Nature has given us these wonderful herbs that can improve our quality of life when included in our diet regularly, while at the same time making our food more tasty and enjoyable.

While the site does not necessarily belong to a company, and is not geographically located in a particular area, most of the spices used in cousines originate in south and south east asia, and the art of medicinal use stems from indian ayurvedic discipline. Hence, it is likely that the site is made by spice enthusiasts from India that would like to share the knowlege and practice of ayurveda with interested people worldwide. 

Site does not have commercial angle but is targeting general audience for more healthier diet and lifestile that includes daily use of spices.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

- HTML
    - WC3 validator results
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18726183/131250724-741a0225-7b44-4aaf-9144-26b8d9d7a080.png)

Answer taken from "https://newbedev.com/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do"
The page will validate using the W3 Validator only when using <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge">. For other values it will throw the error: A meta element with an http-equiv attribute whose value is X-UA-Compatible must have a content attribute with the value IE=edge. In other words, if you have IE=edge,chrome=1 it will not validate. I ignore this error completely as modern browsers simply ignore this line of code

- CSS
    - Jigsaw validator results

## Bugs encountered

Initially the idea was to have a navigation bar with image of spices floating on the top and images/text having to scroll below it which was initially not working. After longer search on the web I realized this works good with ```z-index``` property in CSS for the section I named topbox

## Deployment
