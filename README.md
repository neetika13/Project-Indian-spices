# Spice up your life

This site is targeting people who are foodies and at the same time are health concious. Spices are known to have medicinal and healing properties. They can boost methabolism and promote weight loss, but also fight diabetes, heart conditions, arthritis and even cancer. Nature has given us these wonderful herbs that can improve our quality of life when included in our diet regularly, while at the same time making our food more tasty and enjoyable.

While the site does not necessarily belong to a company, and is not geographically located in a particular area, most of the spices used in cousines originate in south and south east asia, and the art of medicinal use stems from indian ayurvedic discipline. Hence, it is likely that the site is made by spice enthusiasts from India that would like to share the knowlege and practice of ayurveda with interested people worldwide. 

Site does not have commercial angle but is targeting general audience for more healthier diet and lifestile that includes daily use of spices.

## Bugs encountered

Initially the idea was to have a navigation bar with image of spices floating on the top and images/text having to scroll below it which was initially not working. After longer search on the web I realized this works good with ```z-index``` property in CSS for the section I named topbox

In the sign-up form data needs to be sent somwhere. I used the link that was shared previously in the love running example to send the data (https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/). I tried other approaches but I kept getting errors for the action that is supposed to be taken after data submission.

## Deployment

This section describes how the code was deployed

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps
  - In the github repository, navigate to the settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

I used lots of inspiration from the examples given in the https://www.w3schools.com/, for instance how to create navigation boxes, how to make tables, how to use z-index etc.

I also used sniplets of code from the love running https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html example
