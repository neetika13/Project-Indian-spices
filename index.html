            <p >Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine. It aims to preserve health and wellness by keeping the mind, body, and spirit in balance and preventing disease rather than treating it. To do so, it employs a holistic approach that combines diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes.Ayurvedic herbs and spices are also an important component of this approach. They’re thought to protect your body from disease and offer a variety of health benefits, including improved digestion and mental health.</p>
            <h2>History of Spices</h2>
            <p>Spices and herbs such as black pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, and cardamom have been used by Indians for thousands of years for both culinary and health purposes. Spices indigenous to India (such as cardamom and turmeric) were cultivated as early as the 8th century BC in the gardens of Babylon (2).Sushruta, an ancient surgeon (around 4th century BC), used white mustard and other aromatic plants in bed sheets to ward off malignant spirits. He also applied a poultice from sesame to postoperative wounds which may have acted as an antiseptic.Medical writings of Charaka (1st century) and Sushruta II (2nd century) referenced spices and herbs. Sushruta II also used spices and herbs such as cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, and pepper for healing purposes. Spices such as cardamom, ginger, black pepper, cumin, and mustard seed were included in ancient herbal medicines for different types of health benefits. In Ayurvedic medicine, spices such as cloves and cardamom were wrapped in betel-nut leaves and chewed after meals to increase the flow of saliva and aid digestion. <br>

            <div class = "vasco-text"> <p>Spices were traded throught the ages from Asia to Europe via the famous Silk Route. Silk route proved to be unreliable due to political instabilities - Arabic caliphate was established in 7th century leading to decades of war in the middle east. Few centureis later, there were multiple crusades to the middle east raising political instability. Finally in 13th and 14th century Mongols raided middle east and east europe, and made it impossible to trade spices between europe and asia in quantities required to satisfy European nobility. In the middle ages, black pepper was at times higher than price of gold per unit weight. This motivated 15th and 16th century explorers to find an alternative routes to India in order to secure safe supply of spices. After Vasco da Gama discovered a sea rout to India in 1498, multiple portugese, french and later british and dutch colonies were established on indian coast, in order to harvest and trade spices with europeans.</p>
